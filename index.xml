Your footsteps are nearly soundless and the walls seem to absorb every noise from the surrounding air.
The doors open with only a light touch and swing open soundlessly. Smells of popcorn and carpeted floors confirm to you you&amp;rsquo;re in the right place.</description></item><item><title>Compounds corridor</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Compounds/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Compounds/</guid><description>Go back to the castle entrance Compounds corridor As you walk up the stairs you come to a corridor with an odd smell. Odors and colored clouds seem to drift and mingle in the air, sometimes fusing with a small crackle of anabolic potential and alchemical bliss.

The poison is in the dose! Be the alchemist of your own chemistry</description></item><item><title>Crossfit</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Crossfit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Crossfit/</guid><description>Go back to the Sport and subject specific information hallway Go back to the castle entrance The CrossFit Corridor The hallway fills with the smell of ruber tiled floors, sweaty (often shirtless) high fiving men and woman, rusty barbells with bumper plates and some serious athletic potential.
Video&amp;rsquo;s, Q&amp;amp;A&amp;rsquo;s, nutrition, PED&amp;rsquo;s, all related to the sport of CrossFit.

Then I had 2 kids and this process became so interesting to me that I spent WAY too many hours reading as much as I could and paying gestational, lactation, and pregnancy experts to have consult calls with myself purely for the sake of education.</description></item><item><title>Powerlifting &amp; Strongman</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Powerlifting-Strongman/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Powerlifting-Strongman/</guid><description> Go back to the Sport and subject specific information hallway Go back to the castle entrance</description></item><item><title>Pregnancy, Gestation &amp; Post partum</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Pregnancy-Gestation-Post-partum/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/Pregnancy-Gestation-Post-partum/</guid><description>Go back to the Sport and subject specific information hallway Go back to the castle entrance The Pregnancy, Gestation &amp;amp; Post partum corridor Close to the kitchens the corridor fills with the delicious smells of freshly baked goods, cinnamon, cardemon, butter, etc. The clean polished rosewood floors are inlaid with gold symbols representing male, female and everything in between.
Depicted on the walls are beautifully paintings of both food and (semi-)naked athletic bodies, a weird but odly satisfying combination that simply shouts potential fertility and procreation.</description></item><item><title>Q and A - September 2021</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/QndA-September2021/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/QndA-September2021/</guid><description>Go back to QandAs entrance.

The shadows cast by these torches are darker than they should be, you swear you can see your shadow move just slightly out of the cornor of your eye, yet you remained stock still.
The air is freezing cold, breath coming out in clouds and sparkling in the faint blue light before seeming to solidify in crystals upon the floor and walls.</description></item><item><title>Sport and subject specific information</title><link>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/sport-and-subject-specific-information/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pointfirestorm.github.io/quartz/sport-and-subject-specific-information/</guid><description> Go back to the castle entrance Welcome to the first floor, sport and subject specific coridors branch from this main one. The coridor is brightly lit by stained glass windows set every few yards.
