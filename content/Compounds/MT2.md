### Prerequisites
>- Do bloodwork before starting a MT2 protocol
	>- `RBCs have a half life of 120 days, stimulating prolifiration can result in too high CBC panals down the road if not monitored correctly!`
>- Bloodwork shows a need to increase aerobic capacity (second pair of lungs) via increasing CBC panal.
>- General cycle length: 4-6 weeks (can be shortened or extended depending on requirements)
>- Follow up blood panel 8-12 weeks after starting cycle.
