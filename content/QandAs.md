Go back up to [the castle enterance](_index.md)

You decend into a dark hallway, lit by only a few torches casting an eerie blue-ish light. The shadows cast by these torches are darker than they should be, you swear you can see your shadow move just slightly out of the cornor of your eye, yet you remained stock still.

The air is freezing cold, breath coming out in clouds and sparkling in the faint blue light before seeming to solidify in crystals upon the floor and walls.

There is a sign, barely legible above a curved archway that reads:

>  Weary adventurer, much knowledge lays hidden or burried here. Beware the ghouls that wonder these halls, for if context is lost or stolen from you along the way, knowledge gained from these catacombs could turn fowl. Been keen of mind and keep your wits about you.
>
> Signed: - The Wizard 

You walk on ahead, keeping the wizard's remarks in mind. 
Turn a cornor and gasp in the cold air. 

Before you lies a grand labyrinth.
