# The Pregnancy, Gestation & Post partum corridor
Close to the kitchens the corridor fills with the delicious smells of freshly baked goods, cinnamon, cardemon, butter, etc. The clean polished rosewood floors are inlaid with gold symbols representing male, female and everything in between. 

Depicted on the walls are beautifully paintings of both food and (semi-)naked athletic bodies, a weird but odly satisfying combination that simply shouts potential fertility and procreation.
