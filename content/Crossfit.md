# The CrossFit Corridor
The hallway fills with the smell of ruber tiled floors, sweaty (often shirtless) high fiving men and woman, rusty barbells with bumper plates and some serious athletic potential.

Video's, Q&A's, nutrition, PED's, all related to the sport of CrossFit.

## Moving paintings (video's)
On the wall there are several moving paintings with small plaques beneath them describing their content.

## The bookcase (Articles)
On the far wall stand a collection of bookcases. Weird... you can swear you feel a breeze coming from beneath one of the bookcases, but there's a wall behind it!
