# Amphitheater enterance
As you walk from the main hall towards a set of handsome highly polished double oak doors, surrounding sounds seem to dampen. Your footsteps are nearly soundless and the walls seem to absorb every noise from the surrounding air. 

The doors open with only a light touch and swing open soundlessly. Smells of popcorn and carpeted floors confirm to you you're in the right place.

An empty ticket booth displays a roster of currently running movies.
