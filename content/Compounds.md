# Compounds corridor
As you walk up the stairs you come to a corridor with an odd smell. Odors and colored clouds seem to drift and mingle in the air, sometimes fusing with a small crackle of anabolic potential and alchemical bliss. 

At the top of the stairs a plaque on the wall reads:
> The poison is in the dose! Be the alchemist of your own chemistry
