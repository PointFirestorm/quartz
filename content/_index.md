# The wizard's keep 🧙🏰
Welcome to the Wizard's keep - Alex's digital knowledge castle.

You enter the castle via the main walkway, crossing the wide moat full of internet trolls screaming bro-myths at you and asking "Do you even lift bro?". Finally inside you shrug off your travel coat as a deep voice booms out from the shadows of the torchlit hall:

> "Who dares enter my domain? One who seeks knowledge and truths? Be welcome weary traveling friend, for you have found your destination at last. Take with you whatever your heart desires, but make sure not to leave your humanity and compasion behind while you delve for treasure!"

> "Be kind to others, be positive and spread it where you can! That is how we'll all grow!"
