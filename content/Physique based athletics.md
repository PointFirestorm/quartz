# Physique based athletics
A corridor full of doors, each labeled with a neat plaque set above the door. Multiple mirrors are positioned so one can see oneself from any angle while walking this hallway!

A plaque at the top of the stairs reads:
> "Not now chief! I'm in the fucking zone..!"

# Moving paintings (video's)
On the wall there are several moving paintings with small plaques beneath them describing their content.
